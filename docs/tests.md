# Tests

Retro Render has a test scaffold set up that unfortunately requires the browser to be loaded and pointed to the server that runs the tests. The package can be launched from a node script called test.

`npm test`

The test coverage is ... but will only get better. Testing against a DOM is tough apparently.
